# Hybrid-AFP

Apriori uses a breadth-first, candidate generation strategy, while FP-Growth
employs a depth-first, divide-and-conquer approach using frequent-pattern
trees. Hybrid-AFP Algorithm synthesizes these approaches to achieve superior
performance. Hybrid-AFP achieves around 47.4% speedup over traditional
algorithms like Apriori and FP-Growth and similar model accuracy. However, this
Python implementation only works for medium-support threshold scenarios and
Hybrid-AFP is not without its limitations which will be discussed as well.
